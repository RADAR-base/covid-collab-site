  headline: How to participate
  content: "<strong>How do you participate?</strong> <br>Download our app and spend
    a small amount of time reporting your current symptoms, how you are feeling, and
    let us know if you are diagnosed.<br><br>Optionally, you can also fill in more
    in-depth questionnaires every two weeks which will give us a much more indepth
    understanding of your mood. You may also provide us with location data; how much
    you are able to move around and how much time you are spending at home may be
    important to understanding any impact on mental health. Your location data is
    very sensitive - only derived values, such as how much time is spent outside,
    linked to an anonymous ID will be available to analysts.<br><br>If you have a
    Fitbit device then weâ€™d like you to wear it and provide us with a feed of your
    heart rate, activity step count and sleep. This may help us understand symptology
    and provide early warning signs, but is not a requirement for taking part!<br> "
