  content: Covid Collab is a study which hopes to investigate the ongoing coronavirus
    outbreak - both the disease itself and the impact it is having on our lives. It
    is brough to you by the PHIDatalab team, a research group at the Institute of
    Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience in King's College London. We have previous
    and ongoing experience in remotely monitoring disease and mental health through
    our work in <a href="https://radar-base.org/" title="RADAR-base">RADAR-base</a>.<br><br>By
    updating us on your mood, any Covid-like symptoms, and optionally providing us
    access to your movement and Fitbit data, we hope to better understand how we are
    all being affected by the ongoing unprecedented situation.

    <li><b>What are the symptoms? Are there any early predictors of infection</b> (e.g. heart rate, activity, respiration, sleep, loss of sense of smell)? And how reliable are these?</li>
    <li><b>How contagious the virus is?</b></li>

  headline: How to participate
  content: Download our app and spend a small amount of time reporting your current
    symptoms, how you are feeling, and let us know if you are diagnosed.<br><br>Optionally,
    you can also fill in questionnaires every two weeks which will give us a much
    more in-depth understanding of your mood.<br><br>You may also provide us with
    location data; how much you are able to move around and how much time you are
    spending at home may be important to understanding any impact on mental health.
    Your location data is very sensitive - only derived values, such as how much time
    is spent outside, linked to an anonymous ID will be available to researchers.<br><br>If
    you have a Fitbit device then we’d like you to wear it and provide us with a feed
    of your heart rate, activity step count and sleep. This may help us understand
    symptology and provide early warning signs, but is not a requirement for taking
    part!<br>
