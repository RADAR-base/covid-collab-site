    Welcome to the <b>CoViD Collab</b>!

    <p>CoViD Collab is a <b>citizen science</b> research project calling on the donation of data from you to help in the fight against CoViD-19 and learn more about how the outbreak affects people's mental health.</p>

    <p><strong>To do this we need data only you can provide! Let's collaborate to beat the Coronavirus!</strong></p>

  content: Covid Collab is a study which hopes to investigate the ongoing coronavirus
    outbreak - both the disease itself and the impact it is having on our lives. It
    is brought to you by the PHIDatalab team, a research group at the Institute of
    Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience in King's College London. We have previous
    and ongoing experience in remotely monitoring disease and mental health through
    our work in <a href="https://radar-base.org/" title="RADAR-base">RADAR-base</a>.<br><br>By
    updating us on your mood, any CoViD-19-like symptoms, and optionally providing us
    access to your movement and Fitbit data, we hope to better understand how we are
    all being affected by the ongoing unprecedented situation.

    headline: Some questions you'd be helping answer
    content: 'i) How social distancing measures affect the transmission rate (inside families and the general population) of the virus in the normal population?
    What are the symptoms?</br></br>
    ii) Are there any early predictors of infection (e.g. heart rate, activity, respiration, sleep, loss of sense of smell)? And how reliable are these?</br></br>
    iii) How contagious the virus is?</br></br>
    iv) What factors affect how the CoViD-19 disease behaves? Are there any behavioural (e.g. fatigue) or physiological factors that determine progression or mild/moderate/severe outcomes? </br></br>'

    headline: Psychological impact
    content: Many people are already feeling a large psychological impact from the
      outbreak and the measures being required to contain it. We would like to understand
      to just what extent it is affecting people's mood and causing stress.

    headline: Symptoms
    content: 'Our knowledge of CoViD-19 symptomology is presently limited. Your data will help us test our theories and about what symptoms are important.'

  headline: How to participate
  content: Download our Mass Science app and spend a small amount of time reporting your current
    symptoms, how you are feeling, and let us know if you are diagnosed.<br><br>Optionally,
    you can also fill in questionnaires every two weeks which will give us a much
    more in-depth understanding of your mood.<br><br>You may also provide us with
    location data; how much you are able to move around and how much time you are
    spending at home may be important to understanding any impact on mental health.
    Your location data is very sensitive - only derived values, such as how much time
    is spent outside, linked to an anonymous ID will be available to researchers.<br><br>If
    you have a Fitbit device then we’d like you to wear it and provide us with a feed
    of your heart rate, activity step count and sleep. This may help us understand
    symptology and provide early warning signs, but is not a requirement for taking
    part!  <br>

  content: "<strong>Sign up to the study before you are ill or diagnosed with CoViD-19. </strong> Signing up
    to our study before any sign of illness will give us the most useful data. In this
    way we are able to collect data and while you provide context with your questionnaire answers. This information labelling of the data is very important to our analysis.
    You can also help by publicising this study if you know someone who might be interested in participating.<br>"

    If you have a Fitbit and were previously ill, when you sign up you can still donate
    the data from that previous time! Our data scientists are still able to study this data.<br>"

    content: '<img src="/uploads/2020/04/08/Amos_Folarin_Cirx250.png"><br><em><p>“I’m particularly interested in how we can use digital signals from wearable devices and smartphones to track respiratory disease (such as CoViD-19) in the population. One idea we are keen to test is the viability of identifying signals of respiratory illness and even the pre-symptomatic stages of illness.</p>

    <p>Your heart and lungs are part of the machinery responsible getting oxygen around your body, under your healthy baseline, an activity, like taking a walk, will result in your lungs and heart having to work at a level normal to you; however, when you have a respiratory infection your lungs don’t work as well, and consequently, for the same level of activity, your heart will have to work harder. So by having a record of your baseline heart rates for given activity levels when healthy, and your heart rates for the equivalent activity levels when ill, we are looking for a difference in the activity-to-heart rate ratios. Fortunately, this data is exactly what a wearable device like Fitbit provides. </p>

    <p>This is something of a simplification, but it broadly captures the idea. By studying data from a lot of people we hope to identify subtle differences, especially once widespread testing for CoViD-19 comes into place - it will be very interesting to see if we can differentiate the signal of other respiratory infections like colds and flu from CoViD-19”

I’m interested in what impact it is having on our psychological well-being, and what we can do to limit any negative impacts and who might be most at risk of them. For example, we know that regular exercise and being in nature can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Now that there are limits on our freedom to go outside, is the permission to exercise once per day afforded to people in some countries used, useful, adequate or inessential? How long are people able to socially isolate before any ill effects emerge?”</em><br></p>'
