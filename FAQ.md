## About Covid Collab

### Who created Covid Collab study?
CoViD Collab was created by the a team of software developers lead by Dr Amos Folarin and data scientists lead by Prof. Richard Dobson who founded the open source [RADAR-base platform](https://.radar-base.org). Our group based within the Precision Health Informatics Lab [PHIDL](https://phidatalab.org) at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience in King's College London have been involved in several large scale remote data collection projects using wearable, IoT and smartphone sensors.

### Can I contribute data from other wearable devices?
Currently we are working using Fitbit data because this is a popular device where the data is readily accessible, but we have experience with other devices and may include a wider range in follow up versions.

### I've already had CoViD-19 Can I still donate my data?
Definitely! We'd be greatly appreciative of this retrospective data. If you are able to provide the time-point when you are experiencing symptoms or received a diagnosis then we are able to use this as context.


### Can I participate if I don't live in the UK?
Yes, you can. This is a pandemic involving multiple countries and we want to study a wide group of participants.

## Participation

### Can I participate if I'm under 18 years old?
No you cannot participate if you are younger than 18 years old. The current ethics application for the study is restricted to adults over the age of 18.

### Will you notify me when I need to do something?
Yes. The app will send you a notification to indicate you should complete the PHQ8, GAD7 and Symptoms questionnaires (these are done every 2 weeks). The CoViD-19 Symptoms questionnaire can be however filled in at anytime and similarly the CoViD-19 Diagnosis questionnaire -- you do not need to wait to be notified, if you need to complete these, do so at earliest convenience.

### Are there other studies associated with Covid Collab that I can participate in?
Yes. We have asked for your consent to be contacted, if you responded yes to this question in the registration process we'll contact you with information about sub-studies that you are eligible for, you are freely open to join these, or not, and your choice has no impact on your participation in the main study.

### Will I be able to see the results of the study?
We are working on generating a visualisation of the aggregate data. We will also be publishing output from the data as soon as we can. Further information about this will be disseminated on this portal in due course.
