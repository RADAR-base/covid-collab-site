# Frequently Asked Questions

## About CoViD Collab and the Mass Science (Mass Sci) App

### Who created Covid Collab study?
CoViD Collab was created by the a team of software developers lead by Dr Amos Folarin and data scientists lead by Prof. Richard Dobson who founded the open source [RADAR-base platform](https://.radar-base.org). Our group based within the Precision Health Informatics Lab [PHIDL](https://phidatalab.org) at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience in King's College London have been involved in several large scale remote data collection projects using wearable, IoT and smartphone sensors. Leveraging our experience with mobile health and remote monitoring research with RADAR-base, we developed the Mass Science app to help us collect wearable data and study the CoViD-19 disease and pandemic, this work is non-commercial and is entirely developed at [King's College London](https://kcl.ac.uk).

### Can I contribute data from other wearable devices?
Currently we are working using Fitbit data because this is a popular device where the data is readily accessible, but we have experience with other devices and aim to introduce a wider range of devices in follow-up versions of the app (you may email us: [covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk](covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk "covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk") if you are interested in being notified of new wearable devices included in the study).

### I've already had CoViD-19 Can I still donate my data?
Definitely! We'd be greatly appreciative of this retrospective data. If you are able to provide the time-point when you are experiencing symptoms or received a diagnosis then we are able to use this as context.

### Can I participate if I don't live in the UK?
Yes, you can. While our immediate focus is on participants in the UK, this is a pandemic involving multiple countries and we want to study a wide group of participants in their representative countries and at different stages of the pandemic.

### Will I get medical advice from Covid Collab?
No. You will not receive medical advice from this study it is purely for research purposes. Please seek medical advice from appropriate national bodies or your doctor.

## Participation

### Can I participate if I'm under 18 years old?
No you cannot participate if you are younger than 18 years old. The current ethics application for the study is restricted to adults over the age of 18.

### Will you notify me when I need to do something?
Yes. The Mass Science app will send you a notification to indicate you should complete the PHQ8, GAD7 and Symptoms questionnaires (these are done every 2 weeks). The CoViD-19 Symptoms questionnaire can be however filled in at anytime and similarly the CoViD-19 Diagnosis questionnaire -- you do not need to wait to be notified, if you need to complete these, do so at earliest convenience.

### Are there other studies associated with Covid Collab that I can participate in?
Yes. We have asked for your consent to be contacted, if you responded yes to this question in the registration process we'll contact you with information about sub-studies that you are eligible for, you are freely open to join these, or not, and your choice has no impact on your participation in the main study.

#### Is this study part of the DETECT, Corona-Datenspende or COVID-RED
These are similar studies also collecting data from wearable devices. We are in communication with these national projects and are harmonising data some collection with the view to be able to work together on answering common scientific questions.

### Will I be able to see the results of the study?
We are working on generating a visualisation of the aggregate data, this is limited at the moment in the app but we will be providing summary data on this website. We will also be publishing output from the data as soon as we can. Further information about this will be disseminated on this portal in due course.


## Your Data Questions
### How long will my be collected?
see [privacy policy](/privacy_policy.html)
### Where will it be stored?
see [privacy policy](/privacy_policy.html)

### Is this a non profit projects
Yes. Covid Collab is completely non-profit and our use of your data is exclusively for research purposes.

### I want to pause data collection (either temporarily or permanently)
You may stop data collection yourself at any time by logging out and uninstalling the app. At that point we will no longer collect your data. You may also rejoin at any point by installing the app and logging back in. To

### I want to withdraw from the study permanently
You may withdraw from the study -- simply logout and uninstall the app. Then send us an email from the email account you registered with to:
email: [covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk](covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk "covid-collab@kcl.ac.uk")
and
Subject Title: "Covid Collab Study: WITHDRAW"

We will then delete your account from our system. We will no have any link between you and your data. We will keep data prior to withdrawal as it is likely to have already been analysed.

### I want to remove my data
We can only withdraw collecting prospective data. Existing data will be analysed as it is collected and cannot be then separated. It is also important that we can replicate our existing analyses in order to publish them in scientific journals.

### Why do you need my email address?
We need your email address for two reasons, i) so we can verify who you are in the event that you loose your password and ii) if you need to withdraw from the study we will accept a proof of identity based on an email from this address.


## Other
### I spotted an issue or bug I'd like to regport
Yes, while we have a lot of experience running remote monitoring, this project was put together very quickly and so we may have the odd issue from time to time. If you find a bug please Email:
email: [masssci@kcl.ac.uk](masssci@kcl.ac.uk "masssci@kcl.ac.uk")
and
Subject Title: "Covid Collab Issue/Bug"
We are in the process of setting up a bug/issue submission portal which will simplify this process.
